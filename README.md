# CVE-2004-0230 : TCP-Sequence-Number-Approximation-Based-Denial-of-Service
TCP, when using a large Window Size, makes it easier for remote attackers to guess sequence numbers and cause a denial of service (connection loss) to persistent TCP connections by repeatedly injecting a TCP RST packet.
Qualys Reference QID: 82054

This is a old detection which is very frequently flagged on to our network scanners. An exploit setup is created which is very much simple and programmatic.
If the results are negative in terms of packets received / connection termination, I suggest lowering the severity of this CVE in your vulnerability scanner.
